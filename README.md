# UARTCommunication
This project is a method to approach UART communication between two Nexys 4 DDR boards from Digilent. The onboard code was written in VHDL and the driver program was written in C# to manage the COM port communication.
This iteration uses a baud rate of 2000 when the board's clock is set to 100MHz.
